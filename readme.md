# Escrow Sample Smart Contract for Neo Blockchain

This contract is a port of
[safe-remote-purchase.py](https://github.com/Splyse/MCT/blob/master/safe-remote-purchase.py)
originally written by Joe Stewart.

It was ported from python to C# by Harry Pierson (aka DevHawk).

Note, it is highly recommended that you use the 
[Neo Blockchain Toolkit for .NET](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit)
and [Neo-Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express#installation)
with this sample code.
